For the environment setup, I got the help from my friend's (repository)(https://github.com/LostXine/naive-rl). Please check this 
[notebook](https://github.com/LostXine/naive-rl/blob/master/Environment.ipynb) for setting up the openAI gym, pybullet-gymperium. These codes are executed in cluster 
where there is no root permission. Please follow this [notebook](https://github.com/Shauqi/Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Environment_Setup/Environment_Check.ipynb) to
check your setup environment. This code creates Mujoco environment like InvertedPendulum, Walker2D and HalfCheetah. A simulation video of the HalfCheetah can be
found in [here](https://github.com/Shauqi/Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Environment_Setup/HalfCheetahVideo/openaigym.video.0.1151717.video000000.mp4).
